AI-MCP Example - Autogenerated Summary

Overview:
- This folder contains a minimal Model Context Protocol (MCP) example: a tiny server and client demonstrating MCP-style messaging, plus supporting files.

Files and purpose:
- `mcp_server.py`: Example MCP server implementation — shows how to host an MCP-compatible server that accepts requests and responds to model-context style messages.
- `mcp_client.py`: Example client that connects to the MCP server, demonstrates request/response flows and tool/call patterns.
- `README.md`: Human-facing instructions for running the example (local dev notes).
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies required to run the server and client.
- `stocks_data.csv`: Sample dataset used by example scripts or demos.

Key concepts & techniques taught:
- Lightweight RPC-style server/client for model-driven workflows.
- Basic networking, message handling, and simple JSON-based protocol patterns.
- How to wire example data (CSV) into a mini-service for testing.

Suggested next steps:
- Add a short example of running the server and client (I can add runnable commands to this README if you want).
