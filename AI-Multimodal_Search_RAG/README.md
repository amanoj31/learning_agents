AI-Multimodal_Search_RAG - Autogenerated Summary

Mapping of lessons to topics and key teaching points:

- `L1_Overview_of_Multimodality.ipynb` : L1 — Overview of Multimodality
  - Introduces multimodal learning using images (MNIST anchor/positive/negative), contrastive training, and visualization (PCA/UMAP).
  - Hands-on: build a small CNN encoder, contrastive loss, training loop, checkpoints and visualization of embedding space.
  - Top heading (from notebook): "L1: Overview of Multimodality"
  - Technical details & techniques: PyTorch model training loop, `ContrastiveLoss` (cosine similarity + MSE), DataLoader performance flags, UMAP/PCA visualization, checkpointing.
  - Notebook: `L1_Overview_of_Multimodality.ipynb`

- `L2_Multimodal_Search.ipynb` : L2 — Multimodal Search
  - Shows building a multimodal search pipeline with an embedded vector DB (Weaviate), inserting images/videos, and performing text→image, image→image, and video retrieval.
  - Hands-on: set up embedded Weaviate collection, batch imports, near_text / near_image / near_media queries and interactive visualizations.
  - Top heading (from notebook): "L2: Multimodal Search"
  - Technical details & techniques: `weaviate` embedded mode, `vectorizer_config` for multimodal embeddings, base64 media handling, `near_text`/`near_image`/`near_media` queries, UMAP visualization of embeddings.
  - Notebook: `L2_Multimodal_Search.ipynb`

- `L3_LMMs.ipynb` : L3 — Large Multimodal Models (LMMs)
  - Demonstrates calling vision-capable LMMs (Gemini / Google Generative AI) to analyze images and answer prompts about them.
  - Hands-on: configure `google.generativeai`, send images + prompts, and handle model outputs (markdown formatting, streaming toggles).
  - Top heading (from notebook): "L3: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs)"
  - Technical details & techniques: `google.generativeai` client setup, `GenerativeModel` calls with image+prompt, `stream=False` handling, environment variable management for API keys.
  - Notebook: `L3_LMMs.ipynb`

- `L4_Multimodal_RAG.ipynb` : L4 — Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG)
  - Combines retrieval (Weaviate) with LMM generation to implement a multimodal RAG flow: retrieve relevant images/videos then call LMM to generate descriptions.
  - Hands-on: restore pre-vectorized collections, perform retrieval filters, call LMM for image description, and assemble the RAG pipeline.
  - Top heading (from notebook): "L4: Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (MM-RAG)"
  - Technical details & techniques: RAG pattern (retrieve → generate), Weaviate restore & aggregate, `genai.GenerativeModel` usage, filtering by `mediaType`, and glue-helper functions.
  - Notebook: `L4_Multimodal_RAG.ipynb`

- `L5_Industry_Applications.ipynb` : L5 — Industry Applications
  - Shows practical use-cases: extracting structured data from invoices/images, table extraction, flowchart analysis, and generating code/answers from image content.
  - Hands-on: call LMM to parse invoices/tables/diagrams and return structured JSON or markdown outputs useful in production pipelines.
  - Top heading (from notebook): "L5: Industry Applications"
  - Technical details & techniques: vision-to-structured-data prompts, JSON/table extraction prompts, iterative prompt engineering for reliability, and integrating LMM outputs into downstream logic.
  - Notebook: `L5_Industry_Applications.ipynb`

Notes & next steps:
- Many notebooks require API keys (`EMBEDDING_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`) and large dependencies — document env setup if you want runnable guides.
