AI-Langraph_MultiAgent - Autogenerated Summary

Mapping of labs to topics and key teaching points (short technical summaries):

- `lab01- LangGraph101 Building Stateful AI Workflows.ipynb` : LangGraph 101: Building Stateful AI Workflows
  - Introduces LangGraph core concepts: States, Nodes, Edges, Conditional edges and entry points.
  - Hands-on: build an authentication workflow (AuthState, Input/Validate/Success/Failure nodes).
  - Shows compiling a `StateGraph` and running a simple stateful app.
  - Good for learning typed state definitions (`TypedDict`), reducers, and graph construction patterns.
  - Top heading (from notebook): "LangGraph 101: Building Stateful AI Workflows"
  - Technical details & techniques: `StateGraph`, `TypedDict` for type-safe states, `add_node`/`add_edge`/`add_conditional_edges`, `compile()`/`invoke()` lifecycle.
  - Notebook: `lab01- LangGraph101 Building Stateful AI Workflows.ipynb`

- `lab02- Building a Reflection Agent with LangGraph.ipynb` : Building Reflection Agents
  - Presents the Reflection pattern: generate → evaluate → reflect → re-generate loops.
  - Example: LinkedIn post generator that iteratively refines outputs using a reflect chain.
  - Demonstrates `MessageGraph` for conversational state, `ChatWatsonx`/LLM chaining, and router/stop logic.
  - Top heading (from notebook): "Building a Reflection Agent with LangGraph"
  - Technical details & techniques: `MessageGraph`, `ChatPromptTemplate`, `MessagesPlaceholder`, LLM chaining (`prompt | llm`), `add_node`/`add_edge` cycles, and conditional routing (`add_conditional_edges`).
  - Notebook: `lab02- Building a Reflection Agent with LangGraph.ipynb`

- `lab03 - Building a Reflection Agent with External Knowledge In.ipynb` : Reflection + External Knowledge
  - Builds a Reflection agent that critiques its answer, generates search queries, executes web searches, and revises answers.
  - Uses Pydantic models (e.g., `Reflection`, `AnswerQuestion`, `ReviseAnswer`) to enforce structured tool outputs.
  - Integrates external search (Tavily) as a tool and demonstrates binding tools to LLM chains and executing tool results.
  - Top heading (from notebook): "Building a Reflection Agent with External Knowledge Integration"
  - Technical details & techniques: Pydantic `BaseModel` for structured outputs, tool binding via `llm.bind_tools(...)`, `ToolMessage`/`execute_tools` pattern, `MessageGraph` assembly, and iteration-controls (`event_loop` / `MAX_ITERATIONS`).
  - Notebook: `lab03 - Building a Reflection Agent with External Knowledge In.ipynb`

- `lab04-ReAct.ipynb` : ReAct — Reasoning + Acting Agents
  - Introduces the ReAct loop: think (reason) → act (tool call) → observe → repeat.
  - Builds tools (search, domain-specific tools) and a registry, showing how the model emits tool calls which are then executed and fed back as `ToolMessage`.
  - Demonstrates automating ReAct with `StateGraph`: nodes for model invocation and tool execution, plus conditional routing to continue or end.
  - Top heading (from notebook): "ReAct: Build Reasoning and Acting AI Agents with LangGraph"
  - Technical details & techniques: tool construction (`@tool`), `TavilySearchResults`, `ToolMessage` formatting, `add_messages` reducer for agent state, `StateGraph` automation of ReAct cycles, streaming execution and visualization (`graph.stream`, `graph.get_graph()`).
