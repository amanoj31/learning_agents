      "Key takeaways\n",
      "U.S. equity markets rebounded strongly in 2025, driven by solid company fundamentals and resilient consumer spending.\n",
      "Tariff policies and government shutdowns create uncertainty, but investors are focused on stable economic data and earnings growth.\n",
      "Diversification and long-term investment strategies remain crucial amid market volatility and shifting Federal Reserve interest rate policies.\n",
      "U.S. equity markets softened from record highs after rebounding decisively from an early 2025 setback. 1 Since early April, when the S&P 500 narrowly avoided a bear market (a 20% decline or worse), investors have shrugged off higher tariffs and the ongoing government shutdown. Instead,  market participants have focused on company fundamentals and generally stable economic data, including robust consumer spending.\n",
      "Sources: U.S. Bank Asset Management Group Research, Bloomberg, as of October 14, 2025.\n",
      "President Donald Trump’s new tariff policies triggered the market’s February to April decline. “Stable consumer spending and improving corporate earnings enabled investors to look past potential tariff impacts over the summer,” says Bill Merz, head of capital markets research with U.S. Bank Asset Management Group. “However, market volatility has picked up with increased tariff rhetoric between the U.S. and China.”\n",
      "Market breadth expands\n",
      "In 2025, a broader range of industries are driving year-to-date results. Unlike 2023 and 2024, when information technology and communication services stocks led most of the S&P 500’s gains, other sectors now rank among this year’s top performers. Financials reached a new all-time high in September, while industrials and utilities both set new records in October. 1\n",
      "Sources: U.S. Bank Asset Management Group Research, Bloomberg, as of October 14, 2025.\n",
      "Recently, investors’ rising Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut expectations and constructive economic data fueled a recovery in mid- and small-cap stocks. Investors are hoping for lower borrowing costs to ease debt burdens and business stimulus measures in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act lifted earnings expectations. After lagging large cap stocks in 2023 and 2024, mid- and particularly small-cap stocks have closed much of the 2025 performance gap. 1\n",
      "Sources: U.S. Bank Asset Management Group Research, Bloomberg, as of October 14, 2025.\n",
      "Investors are monitoring tariff negotiations\n",
      "The administration continues to negotiate tariff and trade deals with many countries. Over the summer, the U.S. negotiated 15% tariff rates with the European Union, Japan and South Korea. The administration set higher rates on other nations, while extending Chinese negotiations into November.\n",
      "On August 7, 2025, the Trump Administration raised tariff rates on other countries and announced new tariffs on pharmaceuticals, household furnishings and heavy trucks on September 25. More recently, on October 10, U.S.-China trade tensions escalated when the President responded to China’s rare earth export restrictions by threatening a 100% tariff rate and announcing software export controls starting November 1.\n",
      "Currently, the U.S. applies an effective average tariff rate of over 10% on imported goods, up from 2% at the start of the year, and has generated $192 billion in tariff revenue so far. 2 If negotiations fail to lower announced tariffs, the Yale Budget Lab estimates the effective rate could nearly double, 3 though some forecasters project effective tariffs could settle in the mid-teens as consumers and businesses substitute purchases to avoid higher costs.\n",
      "“Investors want to know when higher tariff rates will translate into higher prices. We’ve seen modest acceleration in core goods prices, and investors should expect some additional inflation in coming months.”\n",
      "- Tom Hainlin, national investment strategist, U.S. Bank Asset Management Group\n",
      "“Tariffs in place now address specific sectors, trade fairness issues and even geopolitical concerns,” says Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director with U.S. Bank Asset Management Group. “Rising tariff rates for major trading partners, such as China, Canada, Mexico and the European Union, significantly affect U.S. import costs.”\n",
      "Legal challenges could disrupt President Trump’s tariffs. In late August, a Federal Circuit appeals court upheld the Court of International Trade’s May decision that certain tariffs exceed presidential authority, but the tariffs remain in effect during the appeal. The Supreme Court has agreed to hear the administration’s appeal, consolidating two separate tariff lawsuits. Oral arguments begin November 5, and the court will ultimately rule on President Trump’s unilateral tariff strategy.\n",
      "Sources: U.S. Bank Asset Management Group Research, Bloomberg; August 31, 2017 – August 31, 2025. Effective tariff rate = U.S. customs revenue divided by total U.S. goods imports.\n",
      "Inflation outcomes remain uncertain\n",
      "The ultimate tariff-driven economic consequences remain unclear. Many investors  anticipate tariffs will drive higher inflation, but Consumer Price Index (CPI) changes have been thus far modest. “Investors want to know when higher tariff rates will translate into higher prices,” says Tom Hainlin, national investment strategist with U.S. Bank Asset Management Group. “We’ve seen modest acceleration in core goods prices, and investors should expect some additional inflation in coming months.”\n",
      "Over the past 12 months, CPI rose 2.9% in August, picking up pace recently. Core Producer Prices (which exclude food and energy) rose 2.8%, decelerating from July’s 3.4% pace but remaining above the Fed’s 2% inflation target. 4 Additionally, Federal Reserve (Fed) surveys of its 12 regional districts report higher tariff cost pressures across all regions. 5\n",
      "Government shutdown clouds the economic picture\n",
      "The Federal government shut down for the 11th time since 1980 after lawmakers failed to reach a spending deal. Critical services, including the postal service, social security and Medicare payments, air travel and the military continue, but most other government work stops. This is delaying important economic data releases such as weekly unemployment claims, monthly retail sales, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ employment report.\n",
      "However, high-frequency alternative data continues to show resilient consumer activity. Movie theatre box office receipts, airport checkpoint traffic, and restaurant bookings highlight robust discretionary spending, while private sector retail sales gauges like Johnson Redbook reflect normal spending levels at department stores.\n",
      "Markets react to Trump administration policies\n",
      "In early July, lawmakers passed comprehensive tax and spending legislation, extending 2017’s tax cuts, adding other tax breaks and raising the debt ceiling. Markets responded favorably, and some corporate executives cited the policy change for boosting profit expectations. However, higher tariff prospects, potentially impacting consumers, may temper the tax-cutting policies’ economic benefits.\n",
      "Companies have hesitated to project how tariffs will impact future earnings pending more policy clarity. However, recently some companies have provided investors with more forthcoming earnings guidance, factoring in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s corporate tax relief. As equity prices climb, investors wonder if upward market momentum can continue. “Valuations are elevated,” says Haworth. “But companies remain nimble.” He notes that analysts are raising earnings forecasts into next year, supporting equity prices.\n",
      "Fed interest rate policy remains a key variable\n",
      "Markets closely watch Fed interest rate policy, which influences global borrowing and financing costs. President Trump has frequently criticized the Fed’s reluctance to lower the short-term federal funds target rate throughout most of 2025. After cutting rates three times in late 2024, the Fed held rates steady before lowering the target rate by 0.25% again in September 2025 to 4.00% to 4.25%. The Federal Reserve Summary of Economic Projections anticipates two additional rate cuts by year-end 2025. 6 Fed Chair Jerome Powell recently noted, “The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges the downside risks to employment have risen”. 7\n",
      "Sources: U.S. Bank Asset Management Group Research, Bloomberg, Federal Reserve Summary of Economic Projections on 9/17/2025. Projections through September 2030.\n",
      "President Trump has even suggested firing Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whose term as Chair ends next May, although investors don’t anticipate a change this year. “The President is saying what every borrower wants to hear: that we want lower interest rates,” says Hainlin. “At the same time, the Fed continues to emphasize their three jobs – promoting full employment, ensuring stable prices, and enabling stable long-term interest rates – and that they’re doing their jobs well. It’s a collision of two principles.”\n",
      "Markets typically react positively to Fed rate cuts, but inflation risks linked to tariffs remain an important factor influencing Fed policy and the equity market.\n",
      "A time for appropriate diversification\n",
      "Determining the right asset mix for your portfolio involves making investment decisions that suit your personal situation, not just reacting to market and economic trends. The current market environment reflects lessons from history – stay invested and diversified, despite market volatility and uncertainty. Significant market swings like those experienced in 2025 are nothing new.\n",
      "Sources: U.S. Bank Asset Management Group Research, Bloomberg, Dec. 31, 1989 – Oct. 14, 2025. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Returns shown represent results of market index and are not actual investments and are shown for ILLUSTRATIVE PURPOSES ONLY. The index is described in the disclosures below.\n",
      "Eric Freedman, chief investment officer for U.S. Bank Asset Management Group, encourages investors to take a long-range view and avoid the temptation to time the market. “Stay invested, but make sure you are in the right asset allocation.” Freedman notes that volatile markets, like those in 2025, help focus investors on realistic conversations about risk tolerance. “If you determine you need to adjust your portfolio positioning, utilize a prudent transition plan.” Additionally, Freedman recommends, “If you have extra cash, consider incrementally staging in some of that cash.”\n",
      "Haworth advises those who held cash as a precaution and missed the recent market rally to use a dollar-cost averaging approach to invest over time. While markets at new all-time highs sometimes present risks, Haworth also notes, “New all-time highs are often followed by new all-time highs.”\n",
      "Now is an important time to check in with a wealth planning professional to ensure you are comfortable with your current investments and that your portfolio aligns with your time horizon, risk appetite and long-term financial goals.\n",
      "The S&P 500 Index consists of 500 widely traded stocks that are considered to represent the performance of the U.S. stock market in general. Diversification and asset allocation do not guarantee returns or protect against losses. The Russell MidCap Index provides investors with a benchmark for mid-sized companies. The index, which is distinct from the large-cap S&P 500, is designed to measure the performance of mid-sized companies, reflecting the distinctive risk and return characteristics of this market segment. The Russell 2000 Index refers to a stock market index that measures the performance of the 2,000 smaller companies included in the Russell 3000 Index.\n",
      "Frequently asked questions\n",
      "What is the stock market?\n",
      "Stocks are shares of publicly traded companies investors can buy and sell. These transactions occur on exchanges and over-the-counter (OTC) marketplaces. The activity of pricing, buying and selling stocks occurs in  “the stock market.”\n",
      "Why did the stock market hit so many record highs last year?\n",
      "Stock prices often fluctuate. Between November 2023 and November 2024, the S&P 500 trended higher, following a general downward trend between August and October 2023. The S&P 500 experienced more volatility, beginning in late 2024, with modest setbacks in October and December 2024, then reached an all-time high before a short significant retreat. By mid-2025, stocks regained ground they had lost earlier in the year and the S&P 500 returned to record territory. 1 Solid U.S. economic growth, which boosted corporate earnings, remains a key factor in ongoing market performance. New Trump administration policies, particularly those with an economic impact, are another consideration. Investors appear particularly concerned about significantly higher tariffs on imported goods impacting the economy. Federal Reserve (Fed) interest rate policy can also influence markets. For much of 2023 and 2024, the Fed held the target federal funds rate at a top level of 5.50%. In September, November, and December 2024, the Fed cut interest rates a total of 1.0%, its first rates cut in more than four years. However, the Fed scaled back expectations for 2025. In September 2025, it implemented its first 2025 rate cut, projecting two additional rate cuts this year.\n",
      "What are the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and NASDAQ Composite indices?\n",
      "These three indices are frequently quoted in news reports reflecting daily performance of the stock market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, perhaps the most quoted index, reflects the performance of 30 prominent U.S. exchange listed stocks. The Standard & Poor’s 500 tracks a broader universe of 500 large U.S. stocks. The NASDAQ Composite Index provides a measure of performance of 2,500 National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) Automated Quotations exchange listed stocks. Investors often track these indices, particularly over time, to measure broader stock market performance.\n",

      "U.S. equity markets rebounded strongly in 2025, driven by solid company fundamentals and resilient consumer spending.\n",
      "Tariff policies and government shutdowns create uncertainty, but investors are focused on stable economic data and earnings growth.\n",
      "Diversification and long-term investment strategies remain crucial amid market volatility and shifting Federal Reserve interest rate policies.\n",
      "U.S. equity markets softened from record highs after rebounding decisively from an early 2025 setback. 1 Since early April, when the S&P 500 narrowly avoided a bear market (a 20% decline or worse), investors have shrugged off higher tariffs and the ongoing government shutdown. Instead,  market participants have focused on company fundamentals and generally stable economic data, including robust consumer spending.\n",
      "Markets typically react positively to Fed rate cuts, but inflation risks linked to tariffs remain an important factor influencing Fed policy and the equity market.\n",
      "A time for appropriate diversification\n",
      "Determining the right asset mix for your portfolio involves making investment decisions that suit your personal situation, not just reacting to market and economic trends. The current market environment reflects lessons from history – stay invested and diversified, despite market volatility and uncertainty. Significant market swings like those experienced in 2025 are nothing new.\n",

      "Eric Freedman, chief investment officer for U.S. Bank Asset Management Group, encourages investors to take a long-range view and avoid the temptation to time the market. “Stay invested, but make sure you are in the right asset allocation.” Freedman notes that volatile markets, like those in 2025, help focus investors on realistic conversations about risk tolerance. “If you determine you need to adjust your portfolio positioning, utilize a prudent transition plan.” Additionally, Freedman recommends, “If you have extra cash, consider incrementally staging in some of that cash.”\n",

      "Frequently asked questions\n",
      "What is the stock market?\n",
      "Stocks are shares of publicly traded companies investors can buy and sell. These transactions occur on exchanges and over-the-counter (OTC) marketplaces. The activity of pricing, buying and selling stocks occurs in  “the stock market.”\n",
      "Why did the stock market hit so many record highs last year?\n",
      "Stock prices often fluctuate. Between November 2023 and November 2024, the S&P 500 trended higher, following a general downward trend between August and October 2023. The S&P 500 experienced more volatility, beginning in late 2024, with modest setbacks in October and December 2024, then reached an all-time high before a short significant retreat. By mid-2025, stocks regained ground they had lost earlier in the year and the S&P 500 returned to record territory. 1 Solid U.S. economic growth, which boosted corporate earnings, remains a key factor in ongoing market performance. New Trump administration policies, particularly those with an economic impact, are another consideration. Investors appear particularly concerned about significantly higher tariffs on imported goods impacting the economy. Federal Reserve (Fed) interest rate policy can also influence markets. For much of 2023 and 2024, the Fed held the target federal funds rate at a top level of 5.50%. In September, November, and December 2024, the Fed cut interest rates a total of 1.0%, its first rates cut in more than four years. However, the Fed scaled back expectations for 2025. In September 2025, it implemented its first 2025 rate cut, projecting two additional rate cuts this year.\n",

      "US inflation rose to 3% in September 2025, the highest since January, from 2.9% in August and below forecasts of 3.1%. The Federal Reserve signals the end of US interest rate hikes after inflation eases. Markets are pricing in more than a 96% chance the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points next week, up from an 86% chance before the data. The ultimate tariff-driven economic consequences remain unclear. Many investors anticipate tariffs will drive higher inflation, but Consumer Price Index (CPI) changes have been thus far modest.

      "outlook. In this scenario, continued geopolitical conflicts and trade actions cause inflation to stay higher for longer, driving the Federal Reserve to hike rates.1 Scenarios Baseline (70%): Real GDP growth slowed overall in the first quarter of 2024, coming in very close to our previous forecast’s expectations.2 We expect GDP growth will continue to moderate through the second half of this year and the start of the next, but the story is still positive overall. Consumer spending is forecasted to rise 2.3% this year, up from the 2.2% increase in 2023. Business investment is expected to increase 3% in 2024, down from 4.5% last year. Government spending is forecasted to rise 2.5%. Given that the US economy is expected to outperform many other global economies in the short term, we forecast imports to increase 3.1% on average in 2024, while exports are predicted to rise at a slower pace of 2.4%. Consumer price index (CPI) inflation stays above the 3% threshold for the second quarter of this year before falling to 2.7% by the end of 2024. The Federal Reserve succeeds in walking the tightrope to a soft landing by cutting rates twice in the second half of 2024 and continues with cuts until reaching the neutral rate of 2.5% to 3% by 2027. Job growth slows because current levels of job formation are not sustainable, given demographics and labor force participation. As a result, the unemployment rate falls in the short term, but rises to just under 4% in 2025 before gradually declining through the rest of the forecast period. Major investments prompted by the Inflation Reduction Act provide a boost to manufacturing.3 In addition, investments in intellectual property—such as the use of AI and other novel technologies—will continue to drive growth in the business sector. Overall, we expect the US economy to post real GDP growth of 2.4% this year, but for growth to slow to 1.1% in 2025. Between 2026 and 2028, economic growth is expected to pick back up, with annual gains in\n",

      "general sentiment in markets that the pace and timing of interest rate cuts will not be as aggressive as was once expected. We expect rate cuts will continue at a faster clip in 2025 and 2026 as inflation comes down in earnest, with rates returning to neutral by the first quarter of 2027. Modelling from the New York Fed, and recent comments from the heads of several regional Feds, suggests the neutral rate now rests around 2.5% to 3%.23 In addition, the Fed does not traditionally allow election cycles to influence its rate policy, and in past election years, it has shown a willingness to cut or hike rates according to the economy’s needs.24 Overall, we predict the Federal Open Market Committee to cut rates a total of eight times over the 2025 to 2026 period, bringing the target rate to 2.75% to 3% by the end of 2026. Share image Share twitter linkedin facebook Or copy link Copy Share image Share twitter linkedin facebook Or copy link Copy Prices While CPI inflation has declined from its June 2022 peak, it is not falling as rapidly as we previously forecasted. As of April 2024, 12-month CPI inflation was running at 3.4%, which is slightly lower than the 3.5% year-over-year increase recorded in March, but higher than the values recorded at the start of the year. However, 12-month core CPI inflation slowed to 3.6%, down from 3.8% recorded in March and the lowest year-over-year growth captured since April 2021. The Federal Reserve’s preferred measure, personal consumption expenditure inflation, rose slightly in March to 2.7% year-over year growth. While closer to the Federal Reserve’s target of 2%, it is still above the target, and the pace of decrease in inflation has slowed. Getting inflation down near 2% will require more time. Our forecast therefore assumes that headline CPI inflation will remain above 3% for the first half of 2024, driven in part by temporarily elevated oil prices, before declining steadily starting in the second half of the year.

      "outlook. In this scenario, continued geopolitical conflicts and trade actions cause inflation to stay higher for longer, driving the Federal Reserve to hike rates.1 Scenarios Baseline (70%): Real GDP growth slowed overall in the first quarter of 2024, coming in very close to our previous forecast’s expectations.2 We expect GDP growth will continue to moderate through the second half of this year and the start of the next, but the story is still positive overall. Consumer spending is forecasted to rise 2.3% this year, up from the 2.2% increase in 2023. Business investment is expected to increase 3% in 2024, down from 4.5% last year. Government spending is forecasted to rise 2.5%. Given that the US economy is expected to outperform many other global economies in the short term, we forecast imports to increase 3.1% on average in 2024, while exports are predicted to rise at a slower pace of 2.4%. Consumer price index (CPI) inflation stays above the 3% threshold for the second quarter of this year before falling to 2.7% by the end of 2024. The Federal Reserve succeeds in walking the tightrope to a soft landing by cutting rates twice in the second half of 2024 and continues with cuts until reaching the neutral rate of 2.5% to 3% by 2027. Job growth slows because current levels of job formation are not sustainable, given demographics and labor force participation. As a result, the unemployment rate falls in the short term, but rises to just under 4% in 2025 before gradually declining through the rest of the forecast period. Major investments prompted by the Inflation Reduction Act provide a boost to manufacturing.3 In addition, investments in intellectual property—such as the use of AI and other novel technologies—will continue to drive growth in the business sector. Overall, we expect the US economy to post real GDP growth of 2.4% this year, but for growth to slow to 1.1% in 2025. Between 2026 and 2028, economic growth is expected to pick back up, with annual gains in\n",

      "real GDP forecasted to range between 1.6% and 1.9% per year. Persistent inflation and geopolitical conflicts (20%): While our baseline remains positive, there are always downside risks to any forecast. We see risks centering around three interrelated issues: 1) geopolitical conflicts, 2) persistent inflation, and 3) financial system stress. Major conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East have been simmering for some time; either or both could flare up to a higher level. We see the most likely impact of such escalation coming in the form of higher prices of imported goods and oil. In this scenario, the price of oil spikes to around US$100 for three quarters before gradually declining. Geopolitical conflicts are not just fought with guns. The past two American administrations have used tariffs and sanctions to varying degrees as tools to influence adversaries. The use of these tools can have an impact on the prices faced by American firms and consumers. In this scenario, we model tariffs that increase the cost of imported intermediate inputs by 1% and imported final goods by a further 1%. As a result of the tariffs and the oil price shock, the Federal Reserve is driven to hike rates twice in the near term. Even with this action, CPI inflation persists above 3% until the second quarter of 2025. The latest Federal Reserve Financial Stability Report4 highlights three near-term risks to the stability of the financial system: higher-for-longer interest rates; worsening geopolitical conflict and spillovers; and strains on real-estate markets, particularly for office real estate. In line with the other assumptions outlined above, we therefore model an increase in stress in the financial system. In this scenario, GDP growth is lower than in the baseline scenario, particularly over the next two years. Growth in 2024 is 2.2%; by the following year, the tariffs are fully implemented, and growth in 2025 is just 0.6%. Growth averages 1.7% per year from 2026 to 2028. A golden era\n",
